Day 30/30 – #30DaysOfDevOps | Application Phase: Instagram API Microservice 🔄

After deep-diving into Meta’s ecosystem over the past few days, I finally built and containerized the Instagram automation service using the Meta Graph API.

💻 What I accomplished:
• Developed a custom HTTP wrapper around Meta’s Graph API
• Built a fully Dockerized microservice for Instagram content posting
• Integrated the Instagram microservice with my existing Twitter and LinkedIn services
• Handled token-based access and media permissions
• Aligned the posting logic to follow platform-specific constraints

🧠 Key Learning:
Meta's Graph API is powerful, but it comes with significant friction — permission scopes, sandbox limits, business account restrictions, and non-intuitive docs.
It took a solid mix of documentation, trial/error, and API explorers to get things up and running.
Not my proudest codebase 😅, but it works — and that’s progress.

🎯 Next Step:
Automating parallel workflows for synchronized posting across all three platforms, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn — with a single push 🔁
