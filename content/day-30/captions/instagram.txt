📅 Day 30/30 – Built the Instagram API Microservice 🚀

Today was all about bringing Instagram automation to life!
After days of exploring Meta’s ecosystem and surviving the chaos of access tokens, permissions, and sandbox limits…
I finally coded and containerized my Instagram Microservice using the Meta Graph API.

🔧 What I did:

🧱 Built a custom HTTP wrapper around Instagram’s Graph API
🐳 Dockerized the entire service
🔁 Integrated it with my Twitter and LinkedIn microservices for multi-platform automation
🔐 Handled token-based access and private image uploads

✨ Key Takeaway:
Not gonna lie, this was hard.
Instagram’s API isn’t developer-friendly unless you really know what you’re doing. The docs helped — but only when I knew exactly what to look for.
Also… I’ll admit, the code is not beautiful 🫣, but "if it works, don’t touch it" — right? 😅

📌 Up Next:
Building parallel automated workflows to post on all platforms (X, LinkedIn, Instagram) from a single content push!
