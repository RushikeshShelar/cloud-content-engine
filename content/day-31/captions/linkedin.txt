Day 30 â€“ Final Day of #30DaysOfDevOps ðŸš€

Over the past month, I took on the challenge to learn and apply DevOps end-to-end.
Today, Iâ€™m proud to share that Iâ€™ve built a fully automated social media workflow that posts daily to X, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

How it works:
â†’ Push content to /content in GitHub
â†’ Syncs to S3
â†’ At 10 AM, EC2 spins up
â†’ Fetches content â†’ spins Docker containers
â†’ Each container handles platform-specific posting
â†’ Infra shuts down post-execution

This journey taught me more than just tools â€” it taught me systems thinking, automation principles, and how to turn knowledge into real workflows.

âœ… Whatâ€™s Next?
Refactor this into a production-grade system with scale, logging, alerting & more.

ðŸ“Œ 30 Days âœ…
ðŸ›  Continuous Learning & Continuous Application begins now.
