🚀 Day 30 of #30DaysOfDevOps – Automation Workflow

We’ve finally built a complete automated social media content engine 🔁
Here's how it works 👇

📦 Push content to /content path on GitHub
☁️ Triggers sync to S3
🕙 At scheduled time:
→ EC2 spins up & loads the code
→ Fetches content from S3
→ Spins up Docker containers
→ Each container posts to its platform
🧹 Finally, the infra tears itself down

🔁 Zero manual work, just automated DevOps magic!
This concludes the 30-day journey of hands-on DevOps 🙌

🛠 Up next: Refactor this system for scalability & flexibility
🔁 From learning → building → deploying → automating 💯

Let’s keep the loop running 🌀
