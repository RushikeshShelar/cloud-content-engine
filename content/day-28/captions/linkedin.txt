🚀 Day 28 of #30DaysOfDevOps — LinkedIn Microservice Ready!  
Built, dockerized, and tested the LinkedIn posting service as part of my content automation stack:

✅ What I did:
• Created a LinkedIn Developer Project  
• Built the posting microservice  
• Dockerized and ran successful test posts  
• Set up a local script to cross-post to LinkedIn and X  

❌ Still working on multiple image support


❗ Key Insight: LinkedIn’s API doesn’t support personal profiles — you’ll need a LinkedIn Page. Official SDK is outdated, so custom HTTP requests or wrappers are more reliable.

⏭️ Up Next: Instagram automation using Zapier or Meta Graph API
